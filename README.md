This is intended to be the public GitHub repository for a proof-of-concept chinese language study application to be used as an example for a group of parents.
However, I appear to have mislaid the files for the program in question, perhaps on a thumb drive or cloud storage service, perhaps in some deep dark and hidden recess of my computer.
Rest assured, I will upload the files onto this repository once I locate them.
